This is not YETI
================
This is not YETI, instead this is a fork of YETI developed as part of my final year project on my degree course. I have added extra code to YETI to look at different ways of detecting whether bugs are the same, using mutation testing to create buggy variations of programs to apply YETI to.

If you want the original YETI project it is available [here on Origo](http://www.yetitest.org) until the end of May 2012.
